      <h1>About Byte Me's Chat App</h1>
      <p>
        This is an example chat application designed to be a starting point
        for your CodeU project team work. Here's some stuff to think about:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Algorithms and data structures:</strong> We've made the app
            and the code as simple as possible. You will have to extend the
            existing data structures to support your enhancements to the app,
            and also make changes for performance and scalability as your app
            increases in complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>Look and feel:</strong> The focus of CodeU is on the Java
          side of things, but if you're particularly interested you might use
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the chat app prettier.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Think about a group you care about.
          What needs do they have? How could you help? Think about technical
          requirements, privacy concerns, and accessibility and
          internationalization.</li>
      </ul>

        <li><strong>Luis Loza</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <p>Luis is currently a sophomore at the University of Southern California majoring in Physics/Computer Science and minoring in Cinematic Arts. Aside from taking more naps than he should, Luis spends most of his spare time on Reddit, playing video games, attending concerts, or playing the violin. His favorite artists are Lana del Rey, Vampire Weekend, and Lorde, but he can listen to basically anything except country (don't @ him). Aside from his passion for STEM and the arts, Luis has an undying love for avocado (yes he will pay extra). Hit him up on chat if you ever want to discuss film, music, gaming, or anime.</p>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Cari Gan</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <p>Cari is a junior at UC Berkeley studying computer science. Her favorite artists include Mura Masa and Malaa, but she'll often mindlessly scroll through soundcloud without paying attention to the artists. When she's not sleeping 12/24 hours of the day, you can find her watching netflix, playing Catan with friends, and dancing (the only physical activity she can sustainably do). Avocados? more like avoca-no!!! but only because they're $1.50 for half of one at the poke place she works at (not worth, get the seaweed salad instead).</p>>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Joyaan Bhesania</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <p>Joyaan studies Computer Science at UCSD when she's not busy sleeping or dancing. She loves to try new sports and activities, most recently aerial silks and gymnastics. While she's been on a bit of a Post Malone binge, she usually listens to acoustic music (if you haven't listened to Brooklyn Duo please do so). Cute animals and perfect avocados are life's true beauties.</p>>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Linda Yang</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <p>Linda is currently a sophomore at UCSD studying Computer Science. In her spare time she likes to sleep, eat, and spend countless hours browsing memes online. She also loves to dance, draw and lose in League of Legends. Ice cream and boba also flow through her veins (not sure if that's healthy but ... ) and prefers udon to any other type of noodle (udon is the best noodle ChAnGE mY MinD). She also doesn't even like avocado that much so ya :^)  byE</p>>
